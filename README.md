 Project Title: Synthetic Coffee & Its Health Impact — Data Analysis & Insights
In this project, I explored the emerging world of synthetic coffee — a lab-grown alternative to traditional coffee — and its potential health implications. Using a dataset of 10,000 entries, I analysed consumer sentiment, ingredient profiles, and health-related keywords to understand how synthetic coffee is perceived and what concerns or benefits people associate with it.
 Key Focus Areas:
• 	Compared natural vs synthetic caffeine mentions across user reviews and health forums
• 	Identified patterns in reported side effects, energy levels, and antioxidant claims
• 	Visualised trends using Python (pandas, matplotlib) and interpreted results for non-technical audiences
This project helped me sharpen my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and translating technical findings into beginner-friendly narratives. It also deepened my interest in how tech intersects with food, health, and sustainability.
